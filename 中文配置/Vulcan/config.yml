# Check Configuration.
# enabled: Whether or not the check is enabled or disabled
# punishable: Whether or not the commands will be executed when the max-violations is reached
# broadcast-punishment: Whether or not the punishment broadcast (found above) should be sent when the max-violations is reached
# max-violations: The max violations threshold; when this is hit, the punishment-commands will be executed (if punishable is set to true)
# alert-interval: How often alerts for this check will be sent, for example, 2 will only send alerts for VL 2, 4, 6, 8, 3 will send alerts
#                 for violations 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. If you want to reduce the spam in the chat, then you can use this.
# dont-alert-until: This will make it so that only alerts greater than this value are sent. For example, if you set this to 6,
#                   then only alerts 6 and higher would be sent (anything less than that is still logged, but not sent to staff)
# maximum-ping: 100000 is the default value and your ping can't go higher than this without being kicked for KeepAlive timeout.
#               You won't really ever need to change this as ping doesn't really effect any checks and this can open the possibility
#               of bypasses with ping spoof, however, the option is here nonetheless.
# minimum-tps: If the TPS is lower than this value, the check won't fire.
#
# buffer:
# max: Buffer is how many times the player needs to 'fail' the check in order to actually alert. This is basically how
#         sensitive the check is. I recommend keeping these as default, but if you want the anticheat to be a little more
#         sensitive or less sensitive you can play with them a little. Don't set them too low or too high or else there will be
#         too many false flags or it just won't flag at all.
# multiple: This is what the buffer gets multiplied by after an alert is sent. For example, if you set it to 1, then it wouldn't
#           do anything since (1 * x) is just x. You can also change this if you want alerts to happen slower, for example
#           setting it to 0 would make it so when a player reaches the max buffer of 5 for example, their buffer is set to 0
#           instead of 2.5 (as it would be if the multiple was .5 and not 0.
# decay: How much the buffer should decay if the player doesn't fail the check. Again, don't really touch this if you don't
#        know what you're doing as you can cause checks to either not flag at all or false positive a lot. You need to have a
#        balanced ratio of increasing buffers and decaying the buffer. What we mean by this is that having the decay as 1
#        and increasing the buffer by 1 isn't really balanced as you can just cheat for a tick and then not do anything and
#        you will bypass. On the other hand, a buffer decay of .1 against an increase of one is much more balanced as it ensures
#        that people who constantly fail the checks will continue to alert and be punished yet any little errors will be
#        filtered out and not alert.
# hotbar-shuffle:
# enabled: Whether or not this feature will be enabled. For me.frep.vulcan.spigot.check.impl.combat checks, if the player is failing the check, this will
#          shuffle around the item in their hand. Funny to watch as they try to frantically figure out what's going on
# minimum-vl-to-shuffle: The minimum violations that a player has to be at in order for this feature to function.
# shuffle-every: Interval at which this feature will be executed.
#
# random-rotation:
# enabled: Whether or not this feature will be enabled. When players fail me.frep.vulcan.spigot.check.impl.combat checks, their head will be thrown around
#          to random locations. Again, pretty funny to watch.
# minimum-vl-to-randomly-rotate: Minimum violations which the player needs to be at in order for this feature to work.
# rotate-every: Interval at which this will be executed.
