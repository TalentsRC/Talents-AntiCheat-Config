#### AAC Config (Generated by AAC 4.3.6)
#
# Hey there,
#   Welcome to AAC's configuration file.
#   I've commented the entire thing heavily so every option is easy to understand.
#   If you want a simple place to start, feel free to check out the "Common changes" section below.
#   Feel free to read through the descriptions of checks and options and change them to suit your server.
#   I hope that AAC will perform well and live up to your expectations.

#
# How violations work:
#  - When a player fails a check in AAC, it generates a "violation" which describes what went wrong, and what was
#    expected.
#  - Details about this violation, along with player data, server tps, etc. are saved to a log file in plugins/AAC/logs,
#    with a millisecond-precision timestamp.
#  - The check then generates a number based on options in this config and the details of what happened. If the
#    violation was more severe, the check will generate a bigger number.
#  - This number is added onto a player's "violation level", or "VL". A player's VL also decays over time when they
#    play without failing checks in AAC. A player has a separate VL for each check.
#
# How mitigation works:
#  - Many checks in AAC can not only detect a cheater, but also mitigate their actions.
#  - For example, AAC can teleport a flying player down, restore blocks broken too quickly, block attacks which are
#    suspicious, and temporarily block bow use, to name a few.
#  - Mitigation can be disabled by setting "mitigation.enabled" to false. AAC will continue checking, and will also
#    continue performing threshold actions, but the check will stop influencing the player's gameplay.
#  - Mitigation can be configured to only start after a certain VL is reached. This is set by the "min_vl" option, and
#    is useful to prevent random lag from significantly affecting gameplay.
#
# How decay works:
#  - The decay option in every check allows you to decide how fast violations should go down for each check.
#  - The "interval" option is the time in ticks between VL reductions.
#  - The "delay" option is the time in ticks that AAC waits after a violation before starting to reduce the VL.
#  - The "amount" option is the amount that AAC reduces the VL after each interval passes.
#
# How thresholds work:
#  - Each check has a section labelled "thresholds". This consists of a list of "threshold actions", each of which is a
#    number paired with a command or list of commands.
#  - When a player's VL (see above) for a check goes above the number, or "threshold" for a threshold action, the
#    threshold action is triggered and the command is executed.
#  - The command won't be executed again until the player's VL decays below that number, and then rises above it again.
#  - If there are multiple commands in the same threshold action, they are all executed in the order they appear.
#
# Common changes:
#  - Changing messages:
#     -> All messages sent by AAC are part of a threshold action (see above) tied to an "aac notify" command.
#     -> You can localise these messages by changing the relevant command.
#  - Reducing teleports or setbacks:
#     -> Move and Timer are the main checks which set back for movement.
#        -> Change move.mitigation.min_vl or timer.mitigation.min_vl to a higher value, or increase the decay.
#        -> By default, Move employs "strict" and "direction" checking.
#           -> "strict" checking permits AAC to check if players move too slowly.
#           -> "direction" checking permits AAC to compare a movement with the direction the player is facing.
#           -> These can be disabled for specific scenarios, e.g. only on elytras, or only in water.
#        -> Timer can be affected by severe network lag.
#           -> You can increase timer.max_extra, but cheaters will be able to fake lag (e.g. with Blink) for longer.
#  - Improving hit detection:
#     -> Hitbox sometimes cancels hits if a player is laggy.
#        -> You can increase hitbox.max_reach to reduce reach violations for laggy players.
#        -> You can increase hitbox.mitigation.min_vl so players are less likely to have their hits cancelled.
#     -> You can also disable mitigation for Killaura and Hitbox to stop AAC from blocking hits entirely.
#  - Changing kicks:
#     -> Kicks are caused by a threshold action tied to a /kick command.
#        -> You can remove the threshold action with a /kick command for a check to disable kicking.
#        -> You can increase the threshold for the threshold action to make kicking more lenient.
#        -> You can reduce the threshold for the threshold action to make kicking more strict.
#  - Other:
#     -> Look in the logs for a timestamp that matches a problem that you've experienced.
#     -> Find out which check was failed.
#     -> Locate that check in this config file.
#     -> Look for a relevant option, and change it as described by the comment.
#     -> If you can't solve the issue, please check out the issue tracker or discord server for support.
#
# The "Move" check:
#  - As of AAC 4, Fly, Speed, Elytra and Vehicles have all been merged together into Move.
#  - Detection is performed by comparing a player's movement with simulations of a legitimate client's movement:
#    -> Move is able to detect some cheats which don't appear movement related at first:
#       -> Many killauras will fail Move if "direction" and "strict" are turned on, as a result of silent aim.
#       -> Velocity reduction cheats may fail move. (the Velocity check will still detect 0 velocity)
#    -> Move uses a robust setback system which aims to correct movement rather than block it entirely.
#
# The configurable commands will replace %aac_player%, %aac_ping%, %aac_tps% and %aac_world% with their in-game values.
# If PlaceholderAPI is installed, you will additionally have access to every placeholder that it has registered.
# You can run multiple commands on a single threshold by creating 2 (or more) entries with the same key:
#  thresholds:
#     10:
#      - "broadcast %aac_player% was kicked for cheating"
#      - "kick %aac_player% cheating"
